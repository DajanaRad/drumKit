# drumKit
Simple app but very dear to me. It makes noises when you press some keys on the keyboard.
This is really simple app with a bit of code but I wanted to put it
          here because it is entertaining and I really like this app. When you
          press some keys on keyboard you can hear sound and see a bit of css
          transition. It is also responsive for all devices but because there is no keyboard on mobile it's not working.
