# drumKit
Simple app but to me very dear. It makes noises when you press some keys on the keyboard.
This is really simle app with a bit of code but i whanted to put it
          here because it is entertaining and i really like this app. When you
          press some keys on keyboard you can here sound and a bit of css
          transition. It is also responsive for all devices.
